# daily-accountibility-journal
I created this program to keep a journal for myself.
Currently it only saves "list of todos and learnings" and "streaks".
You can create a journal and save it as pdf.

First create your virtual environment, for example with:
``` python -m venv venv ```

Install required packages:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

Go to folder daily-accountibility-journal.

Start program with:
```py daily.py```

You can also run the progam quickly with the batch file in ```bin```, but you should have a virtual env called venv, and it cannot be conda.
